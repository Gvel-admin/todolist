# ASSIGNEMENT: TODOLIST

## Main functionality

- Show the following list of tasks
- Possibility to add new tasks to the list

## Extra tasks

- Remove tasks: tasks can be removed from the list
- Second list: completed tasks. Somehow it must be possible to mark tasks as completed and store them in this list
- Add importance to the task: while adding a task, you can select the priority or importance of the task and show it in the list (different color, first in the list, etc...)
- Add a date to the task: if the date is between the date it was added and today, it should appear as finished. If not, pending.
- Task filter: be able to filter by name (or other property if you added dates for example)
